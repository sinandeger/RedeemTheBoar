keras_implementation is an implementation of a U-Net (as defined in https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597) using Keras. A U-Net is consists of a contracting path and an expansive path, each made of convolutional blocks.     


It achieves ~%97 accuracy on the training set, and an IOU score of  on the test sample.
